## Unit Test

    - Unit test should cover all small pure functions of an application
    - Small pure functions: take an input and return an output that do one thing really well, one thing at a time.
    - Pure function is a function that has no side effects
    - ** Unit Test: ** Test input and output.
    - Deterministic: Same input -> Same output

    - Unit tests don't test the contract.
    - Contract is the connection between things ie. server and DB, sign in fuction and load fuction.
